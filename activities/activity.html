    <h1>Online Life</h1>
    <p class="post-time">Feb 2, 2021 | Berhampore, WB | <span onclick="openNav()">More</span></p>
    <p>
      The 1st yr. int. PhD students are still at home and are waiting to be called
      back to campus. After joining IISER, I was very excited that I would finally
      get to visit and stay in a different state. More so because it is a beautiful
      place like Trivandrum, Kerala. Right now we are having a lot of online classes
      and recorded lectures, keeping us busy. However, to say the least nothing can
      replace the interaction b/w professors and students in a classroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      A couple of courses have not been offered yet beacuse the mode of instruction is
      online. These are mostly lab courses and courses requiring extensive computation
      power. However, the academics have informed that they will be offered during the
      3 months long summer vacations. The response from students has been lukewarm so far,
      as the summer is also when people join labs for internship. Nevertheless I really liked
      a couple of courses so far, these includes: BIO314 (advance genetics and genome
      biology), BIO314 (biochemistry), BIO3201 (genome stability), BIO322 (immunology)
      and BIO321 (structural biology).
    </p>
    <p>
      Hopefull we will be called back to campus by early April. The campus as is mentioned
      on the <a href="https://www.iisertvm.ac.in">iiser tvm website</a> is indeed a picturesque place and is located in the western
      ghat forests. Once we are back on campus, I plan to make good use of this page and
      share pictures and stories of our daily lives. Through this small initiative, I hope
      to reach out to the students about the excitement of scientific pursuits!

    <h1>Awareness to minimise ganges pollution</h1>
    <p class="post-time">Feb 3, 2021 | Berhampore, WB | <span onclick="openNav()">More</span></p>
    <p>
      Recently I got an opportunity to be part of a team, monitoring ganges pollution and at the same time
      spreading awareness to minimise it. The team majorly comprises of military veterans who
      have decided to spend their retirement lives fruitfully. <a href="https://www.atulyaganga.com/">The Atulya Ganga Project</a>
      is an adventure initiative coupled with the long term goal to keep the Ganges clean. The team consists of a group
      of walkers who have taken up the challenge for a "Mundamal Parikrama" of the Ganges, while collecting water samples along
      their way for testing. The Atulya Ganga team have also set up an <a href="https://www.atulyaganga.com/Dashboard/wsadashboard_new.php">online dashboard</a>
      for detailed information regarding it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Berhampore Adventure Club supported the team and acted as their as liasion in the Murshidabad district.
      We decided to hold a water rafting adventure on bhagirathi from Krishnapur to Berhampore, to spread awareness
      against water pollution.
